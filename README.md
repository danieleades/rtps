[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/danieleades/rtps/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=zMXM0QthTc)](https://codecov.io/gh/danieleades/rtps)

Implementation of the DDS "Real-time Publish-Subscribe Protocol" (RTPS).

The specification for this protocol can be found [here](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/2.5/PDF)


## Design Principles

1. This implementation aims to be idiomatic Rust
2. where possible, and with respect to the first principle, this implementation aims to follow the spec closely, for ease of reference
